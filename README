1. To use the program you'll need python2.5 or newer but older than python3.0. To use
just type ./pyContacts, you may need to make it executable first though (chmod a+x pyContacts.py).
It will store your contacts in a csv file located at ~/.pyContactsCSV.

2. This project was started because I needed a way to store my contacts in my phone if my SIM should ever
fail on my phone I wanted to have a backup.

3. To contribute to this project please send an e-mail to commits@projektenterprises.com with the subject
[pyContacts - %reason%] (reasons include: bug-patch, improvement, etc) and I will review the change and
then possibly apply to head git repo located on github.
