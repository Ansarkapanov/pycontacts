1. To use the program you'll need python2.5 or newer but older than python3.0. To use
just type ./pyContacts, you may need to make it executable first though (chmod a+x pyContacts.py).
It will store your contacts in a csv file located at ~/.pyContactsCSV.

2. This project was started because I needed a way to store my contacts in my phone if my SIM should ever
fail on my phone I wanted to have a backup.

3. To contribute to this project please send an e-mail to commits@projektenterprises.com with the subject
[pyContacts - %reason%] (reasons include: bug-patch, improvement, etc) and I will review the change and
then possibly apply to head git repo located on github.

4. If you used version 0.2 or older run convert020to031.py before running the new version of pyContacts, 
if you used version 0.3.0 then use convert030to031.py to convert to the new formats...
PLEASE NOTE: IGNORING THIS WARNING WILL CAUSE YOU TO LOSE ALL YOUR CONTACTS!!!!
